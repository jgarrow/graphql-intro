This project is intended as a walkthrough project for an introduction to [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) walkthrough stream.

On the `main` branch, all you'll find is a basic `package.json`. 

On the `final` branch, you'll find a small GraphQL server that uses the [PokeAPI REST API](https://pokeapi.co/) as a datasource. You can refer to this branch for guidance when setting up your own Apollo Server.
